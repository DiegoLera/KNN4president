abstract = "Prediction of solar irradiance is essential for minimizing energy costs and providing high power quality in electrical power grids with distributed solar photovoltaic generations. However, for residential and small commercial users deploying on-site photovoltaic generations, the historical irradiance data can not be obtained directly because of expensive solar irradiance meters. Thanks to increasingly improved weather forecasting service provided by local meteorological organizations, weather forecasting data such as temperature, dew point, humidity, visibility, wind speed and descriptive weather summary, are becoming readily available through the Internet, while the irradiance forecasting data are often unavailable. This paper proposes a novel solar prediction scheme for hourly day-ahead solar irradiance prediction by using the weather forecasting data. This study formulates the prediction problem as a structured output prediction problem jointly predicting multiple outputs simultaneously. The proposed prediction model is trained by using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks taking into account the dependence between consecutive hours of the same day. We compare persistence algorithm, linear least square regression and multilayered feedforward neural networks using backpropagation algorithm (BPNN) for solar irradiance prediction. The experimental results on a dataset collected in island of Santiago, Cape Verde, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms these competitive algorithms for single output prediction. The proposed algorithm is %18.34 more accurate than BPNN in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) by using about 2 years training data to predict half-year testing data. Moreover, compared with BPNN, the proposed algorithm also shows less overfitting and better generalization capability. For a case using 10 years of historical data to predict 1 year of irradiance data, the prediction RMSE using the proposed LSTM algorithm decreases by 42.9% against BPNN."

abstract = "Wind power generation differs from conventional thermal generation due to the stochastic nature of wind. Thus wind power forecasting plays a key role in dealing with the challenges of balancing supply and demand in any electricity system, given the uncertainty associated with the wind farm power output. Accurate wind power forecasting reduces the need for additional balancing energy and reserve power to integrate wind power. Wind power forecasting tools enable better dispatch, scheduling and unit commitment of thermal generators, hydro plant and energy storage plant and more competitive market trading as wind power ramps up and down on the grid. This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods and advances in wind power forecasting and prediction. Firstly, numerical wind prediction methods from global to local scales, ensemble forecasting, upscaling and downscaling processes are discussed. Next the statistical and machine learning approach methods are detailed. Then the techniques used for benchmarking and uncertainty analysis of forecasts are overviewed, and the performance of various approaches over different forecast time horizons is examined. Finally, current research activities, challenges and potential future developments are appraised."
