abstract = "Prediction of solar irradiance is essential for minimizing energy costs and providing high power quality in electrical power grids with distributed solar photovoltaic generations. However, for residential and small commercial users deploying on-site photovoltaic generations, the historical irradiance data can not be obtained directly because of expensive solar irradiance meters. Thanks to increasingly improved weather forecasting service provided by local meteorological organizations, weather forecasting data such as temperature, dew point, humidity, visibility, wind speed and descriptive weather summary, are becoming readily available through the Internet, while the irradiance forecasting data are often unavailable. This paper proposes a novel solar prediction scheme for hourly day-ahead solar irradiance prediction by using the weather forecasting data. This study formulates the prediction problem as a structured output prediction problem jointly predicting multiple outputs simultaneously. The proposed prediction model is trained by using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks taking into account the dependence between consecutive hours of the same day. We compare persistence algorithm, linear least square regression and multilayered feedforward neural networks using backpropagation algorithm (BPNN) for solar irradiance prediction. The experimental results on a dataset collected in island of Santiago, Cape Verde, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms these competitive algorithms for single output prediction. The proposed algorithm is %18.34 more accurate than BPNN in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) by using about 2 years training data to predict half-year testing data. Moreover, compared with BPNN, the proposed algorithm also shows less overfitting and better generalization capability. For a case using 10 years of historical data to predict 1 year of irradiance data, the prediction RMSE using the proposed LSTM algorithm decreases by 42.9% against BPNN."

abstract = "Wind power generation differs from conventional thermal generation due to the stochastic nature of wind. Thus wind power forecasting plays a key role in dealing with the challenges of balancing supply and demand in any electricity system, given the uncertainty associated with the wind farm power output. Accurate wind power forecasting reduces the need for additional balancing energy and reserve power to integrate wind power. Wind power forecasting tools enable better dispatch, scheduling and unit commitment of thermal generators, hydro plant and energy storage plant and more competitive market trading as wind power ramps up and down on the grid. This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods and advances in wind power forecasting and prediction. Firstly, numerical wind prediction methods from global to local scales, ensemble forecasting, upscaling and downscaling processes are discussed. Next the statistical and machine learning approach methods are detailed. Then the techniques used for benchmarking and uncertainty analysis of forecasts are overviewed, and the performance of various approaches over different forecast time horizons is examined. Finally, current research activities, challenges and potential future developments are appraised."

Recently, machine learning has been widely used for forecasting precipitation, and the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, one of machine learning techniques, showed good performance. In this paper, we propose an improved KNN algorithm, which offers robustness against different choices of the neighborhood size k, particularly in the case of the irregular class distribution of the precipitation dataset. Then, based our improved KNN algorithm, a new precipitation forecast approach is put forward. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness of our proposed precipitation forecast approach based on improved KNN algorithm."

abstract = "This paper focuses on fire prevention in UCG processes within active mines by means of temperature forecasting by a multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) approach. The main aim was to develop a model to forecast the temperature of the syngas with one hour of anticipation based on information from different parameters measured every hour (snapshots) during the experiment. As the response time of the syngas temperature to modifications in the composition/amounts of the gasifying agent is very short, this will reduce the temperature if necessary while keeping it as high as possible within the safety parameters, as UCG is a strongly exothermic process. The same model can be used to prevent undesired drops in the temperature of the syngas, as low temperatures could increase the precipitation of contaminants, causing a slowdown in the syngas flow and thus decreasing its calorific value. Temperature forecasting was achieved successfully; thus, the use of artificial intelligence and, specifically, a supervised learning predictive technique such as MARS models will allow active mines for the first time to adequately prevent the risk of fires while obtaining the best syngas quality in UCG processes."

abstract = { Abstract Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) is a new methodology, due to Friedman, for nonlinear regression modeling. MARS can be conceptualized as a generalization of recursive partitioning that uses spline fitting in lieu of other simple fitting functions. Given a set of predictor variables, MARS fits a model in the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions of predictors chosen during a forward and backward recursive partitioning strategy. MARS produces continuous models for high-dimensional data that can have multiple partitions and predictor variable interactions. Predictor variable contributions and interactions in a MARS model may be analyzed using an ANOVA style decomposition. By letting the predictor variables in MARS be lagged values of a time series, one obtains a new method for nonlinear autoregressive threshold modeling of time series. A significant feature of this extension of MARS is its ability to produce models with limit cycles when modeling time series data that exhibit periodic behavior. In a physical context, limit cycles represent a stationary state of sustained oscillations, a satisfying behavior for any model of a time series with periodic behavior. Analysis of the yearly Wolf sunspot numbers with MARS appears to give an improvement over existing nonlinear threshold and bilinear models. A graphical representation for the models is given. }

 abstract = {A new method is presented for flexible regression modeling of high dimensional data. The model takes the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well as the parameters associated with each one (product degree and knot locations) are automatically determined by the data. This procedure is motivated by the recursive partitioning approach to regression and shares its attractive properties. Unlike recursive partitioning, however, this method produces continuous models with continuous derivatives. It has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few variables. In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately identifies the additive contributions and those associated with the different multivariable interactions.},
